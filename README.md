# Smapp: A single page web application 

## Introduction
The single web page application known as Student Mapp or (Smapp), is a navigation application designed to help students navigate throughout Solent University.  The search system will allow students and other users to locate all the university sites, buildings and rooms. The routing system will allow users to select two locations and be provided with all possible routes and information on how to get there.

## Methodology

Four agile sprints were implemented to design, build, test and review the prototype. Each prototype was referenced Markup or ‘Mark’ with the number of each prototype (e.g. Mark-1).  User stories were created based on previous user research. Each prototype was designed using Sketch and modified from the previous prototypes, using different design components from a design library. Each prototype was built through React functional components (React Components, 2020).  MapBox (MapBox, 2020) was then used to create the 2D world map and Leaflet (Leaflet, 2020) was used to simulate UI elements.  Usability testing was then integrated for each prototype to test usability and user perception.  After testing, each prototype was reviewed to identify any early design issues that need to be addressed within the next sprint.  

### Mark 1

Mark 1 was designed to be tested by users to consider ease of use of the basic design components and controls such as adding markers, and ability to maneuver through the map with zoom controls using React Class Components, React-Leaflet and Mapbox. 

#### Mark 1 User Story 

As a user I want to be able to add a marker to the map so that I can easily search for my desired location


#### View Mark-1
First make sure you have cloned and installed locally correctly.  
1. Use `git branch checkout smapp-app-mk1` within the terminal to move to Mark 1 prototype. 
2. Run in terminal `npm start` 

### Mark 2

Mark 2 was designed to be tested by users to consider ease of use of the basic design components and controls such as adding markers, geolocation and ability to maneuver through the map with zoom controls using React Functional Components, LeafletJS and Mapbox. 

#### Mark 2 User Story 

As a user I want to be able to retrieve my current location on the map


#### View Mark-2
First make sure you have cloned and installed locally correctly.  
1. Use `git branch checkout smapp-app-mk2` within the terminal to move to Mark 2 prototype. 
2. Run in terminal `npm start` 

### Mark 3

Mark 3 was designed to be tested by users to consider ease of use of searching for locations through the use of a search bar. 

#### Mark 3 User Story 

As a user I want to be able to find for a location via a keyword search


#### View Mark-3
First make sure you have cloned and installed locally correctly.  
1. Use `git branch checkout smapp-app-mk3` within the terminal to move to Mark 3 prototype. 
2. Run in terminal `npm start` 

### Mark 4

Mark 4 was designed to be tested by users to consider ease of use of searching for locations and provide the correct route to get from one destination to another. 

#### Mark 4 User Story 

As a user I want to be able to be provided with a route and directions from one marker to another.

#### View Mark-4
First make sure you have cloned and installed locally correctly.  
1. Use `git branch checkout smapp-app-mk4` within the terminal to move to Mark 3 prototype.
